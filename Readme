Postfix configuration:
    Most off all I used default postfix configuration. Just few thing were changed.
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        added parameter 'recipient_canonical_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/recipient_canonical'
        - This means when postfix receive emails it will map it to /etc/postfix/recipient_canonical file.
    /etc/postfix/recipient_canonical
        added string '/optyn.+_..+@optynmail.com/ apps'
        - This means that all emails which mach this regexp will be redirected to apps@optynmail.com
    /etc/aliases
        added alias 'apps: "|/home/deploy/.rvm/bin/ruby-1.9.3-p385@mail /srv/apps/optyn_magic/current/lib/mail_receiver.rb"'
        - Redirects all emails from apps@optynmail.com to ruby script mail_receiver.rb
Optyn Magic App:
    It`s a simple ruby application. It has structure similar to rails because I used some rails gems which required such structure.
    lib/mail_receiver.rb
        - This script get emails from postfix. It should be extremely lite. Because postfix will load this file in memory every time
        when it receive an email. And high email traffic can load the server. This script just send all emails to rescue queue.
    lib/emails_processor.rb
        - It pull emails from rescue queue and store them into database.
    rake messages:create
        - It runs by cron every 5 minutes (Using whenever gem). It find all unsent emails from database and send them to optyn.com
    lib/api_calls.rb
        - Contain methods for connection to optyn.com
Deploy
    To deploy just run 'cap deploy'
